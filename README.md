# Concert Finder

Concert finder is a web application that was developed with React, Flask, HTML, and CSS. Its goal is to discover upcoming concerts featuring 
a user's favorite artists. The app integrates Spotify API and Ticketmaster API to fetch a user's artists, find real-time concert recommendations, and 
tailored geolocation-based suggestions. Some challenges faced were familiarizing with the documentation for the used APIs. Another challenge faced was 
finding a method to suggest different people that had similar favorite artists to the user.


## Requirements

The application was developed using Node v17.9.1 and npm 8.11.0.


## Get started

The user will be prompted to login to their spotify and will be displayed their short term favorite artists initially.
