# Concert Finder

Concert finder is a web application that was developed with React, Flask, HTML, and CSS. Its goal is to discover upcoming concerts featuring 
a user's favorite artists. The app integrates Spotify API and Ticketmaster API to fetch a user's artists, find real-time concert recommendations, and 
tailored geolocation-based suggestions. Some challenges faced were familiarizing with the documentation for the used APIs. Another challenge faced was 
finding a method to suggest different people that had similar favorite artists to the user.


## Requirements

The application was developed using Node v17.9.1 and npm 8.11.0.


## Get started

The user will be prompted to login to their spotify and will be displayed their short term favorite artists initially along with Ticketmaster's concert recommendation. The user can change the time period to view their favorite artists based on a specific range.
